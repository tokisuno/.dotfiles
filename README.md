## How they're managed
* This is cloned as a git repo in $HOME. They are managed through manually-created symlinks. I don't find using symlinks to be much of a bother since I don't use a lot of programs to begin with. My config isn't a big rice that's massively complex.
* From 2024-06-21, I replaced qtile with awesome. Qtile shit the bed for me and completely killed a day of productivity. Python wasn't made for window management. Although the default awesome config looks like it was formatted by a 10 year old child trying vyvanse for the first time, I threw something together that works.

*for my neovim config, refer to [this](https://github.com/tokisuno/nvim)*
