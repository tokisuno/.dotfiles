# tokisuno's Dotfiles!

## System info
- Distro: Arch Linux
- Shell: zsh
- Terminal: alacritty + tmux
- WM: Qtile + qtile-extras (AUR)

## How they're managed
This is cloned as a git repo in $HOME. They are managed through manually-created symlinks. I don't find using symlinks to be much of a bother since I don't use a lot of programs to begin with. My config isn't a big rice that's massively complex. The only module I use from qtile-extras is UPower for my battery, that's it. Most of what I do is in the browser, or my terminal.

*for my neovim config, refer to [this](https://github.com/tokisuno/nvim)*
